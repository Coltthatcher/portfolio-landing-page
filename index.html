  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <div class="important">
    <p>Before beginning the <span class="highlight">Epicodus</span> program I was somewhat of a jack of all trades. Having gone to a Ida B Wells school for social justice for my highschool education, I was excited to start my path in college. Unfortunately life has a weird way of doing things and I had to drop those dreams and enter the workforce. After working in service industry, event production, construction for the last five years. I finally decided after the pandemic that life is too short and I needed to pursue higher education. I was fortunate enough to hear of <span class="highlight">Epicodus</span> through a friend, and immediately felt it would be the right path for me.</p>
